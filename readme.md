Dear all
First of all thank you for the great oppurtunity and I would to assure you that I am looking forward for your updates.
I tried my best but I would like to clarify that time is very limited due to work and family so some adaptions have been made to the original requests.
For the rest of the code I did the best I could.
The username is douleutaras
and password is test
the endpoint for retrieving the JWT token is /auth
the /twitter/<int:word_count>/<format>
endpoint is where the cloud will be generated and you have to provide the word count I.e 25 and format is json or csv.
This endpoint requires  the jwt generated from the auth endpoint and must be given as shown 
JWT token value
The hashtag topic is #Marvel I hope you like comics and the number of items that I retrieve is relatively small in order to avoid delays.

Once again thanx for the opportunity 
BR
Kyriakos
